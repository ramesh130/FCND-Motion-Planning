# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Load the 2.5D map in the colliders.csv file describing the environment.
2. Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.
3. Define the start and goal locations.
4. Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm.
5. Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.
6. Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0].
7. Write it up.
8. Congratulations!  Your Done!

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.

### Explain the Starter Code

#### 1. Explain the functionality of what's provided in `motion_planning.py` and `planning_utils.py`
These scripts contain a basic planning implementation that includes a Finite State Machine to control the Drone. In `motion_planning.py` there is an additional state PLANNING, between ARMING and TAKEOFF. This method's responsibility is to calculate the waypoints necessary for the drone to arrive at its destination.

The method plan_path define a motion planning pipeline. first, read in the global home and obstacle map from colliders.csv file and then, create a grid representation for the drone's environment with the safety margines. Next, define start and a goal point in on the grid. After that, run the path planner (A* Algorithms) to find a path from start to goal. Convert the path to waypoints. Finally, send the waypoints to the simulator.

### Implementing Your Path Planning Algorithm

#### 1. Set your global home position
Here students should read the first line of the csv file, extract lat0 and lon0 as floating point values and use the self.set_home_position() method to set global home. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.

The home position is read at motion_planning.py line 124. It use the function read_home added to planning_utils.py. Here is the code used-

```
def read_home(filename):
    """
    Reads home (lat, lon) from the first line of the `file`.
    """
    with open(filename) as f:
        first_line = f.readline()
    match = re.match(r'^lat0 (.*), lon0 (.*)$', first_line)
    if match:
        lat = match.group(1)
        lon = match.group(2)
    return np.fromstring(f'{lat},{lon}', dtype='Float64', sep=',')
```

#### 2. Set your current local position
Here as long as you successfully determine your local position relative to global home you'll be all set. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.

The code snippet below is used for conversion(Line 131)

```
local_north, local_east, local_down = global_to_local(self.global_position, self.global_home)
```

Meanwhile, here's a picture of me flying through the trees!

#### 3. Set grid start position from local position
This is another step in adding flexibility to the start location. As long as it works you're good to go!

This is done bby code below (line 145)

```
grid_start_north = int(np.ceil(local_north - north_offset))
grid_start_east = int(np.ceil(local_east - east_offset))
grid_start = (grid_start_north, grid_start_east)
```
#### 4. Set grid goal position from geodetic coords
This step is to add flexibility to the desired goal location. Should be able to choose any (lat, lon) within the map and have it rendered to a goal location on the grid.

This is done bby code below (line 150)

```
goal_north, goal_east, goal_alt = global_to_local(self.goal_global_position, self.global_home)
        grid_goal = (int(np.ceil(goal_north - north_offset)), int(np.ceil(goal_east - east_offset)))
```

#### 5. Modify A* to include diagonal motion (or replace A* altogether)
Minimal requirement here is to modify the code in planning_utils() to update the A* implementation to include diagonal motions on the grid that have a cost of sqrt(2), but more creative solutions are welcome. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.

The diagonals movements were implemented by adding them to the Action enum in planning_utils.py

```
SOUTH_EAST = (1, 1, sqrt(2))
NORTH_EAST = (-1, 1, sqrt(2))
SOUTH_WEST = (1, -1, sqrt(2))
NORTH_WEST = (-1, -1, sqrt(2))
```

The valid_actions method is modified to take those actions into account.

```
    if x + 1 > n or y + 1 > m or grid[x + 1, y + 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.SOUTH_EAST)
    if x - 1 < 0 or y + 1 > m or grid[x - 1, y + 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.NORTH_EAST)
    if x + 1 > n or y - 1 < 0 or grid[x + 1, y - 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.SOUTH_WEST)
    if x - 1 < 0 or y - 1 < 0 or grid[x - 1, y - 1] == 1:
        valid_actions.remove(Action.NORTH_WEST)
```

#### 6. Cull waypoints 
For this step you can use a collinearity test or ray tracing method like Bresenham. The idea is simply to prune your path of unnecessary waypoints. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.

The path was pruned at line 162 using collinearity(collinearity_prune function) with the method provided by the lectures. 

```
def collinearity_prune(path, epsilon=1e-5):
    """
    Prune path points from `path` using collinearity.
    """
    def point(p):
        return np.array([p[0], p[1], 1.]).reshape(1, -1)

    def collinearity_check(p1, p2, p3):
        m = np.concatenate((p1, p2, p3), 0)
        det = np.linalg.det(m)
        return abs(det) < epsilon

    pruned_path = [p for p in path]
    i = 0
    while i < len(pruned_path) - 2:
        p1 = point(pruned_path[i])
        p2 = point(pruned_path[i+1])
        p3 = point(pruned_path[i+2])

        # If the 3 points are in a line remove
        # the 2nd point.
        # The 3rd point now becomes and 2nd point
        # and the check is redone with a new third point
        # on the next iteration.
        if collinearity_check(p1, p2, p3):
            # Something subtle here but we can mutate
            # `pruned_path` freely because the length
            # of the list is check on every iteration.
            pruned_path.remove(pruned_path[i+1])
        else:
            i += 1
    return pruned_path
```

# Extra Challenges: Real World Planning

For an extra challenge, consider implementing some of the techniques described in the "Real World Planning" lesson. You could try implementing a vehicle model to take dynamic constraints into account, or implement a replanning method to invoke if you get off course or encounter unexpected obstacles.
